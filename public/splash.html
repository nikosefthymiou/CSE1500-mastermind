            <br>
            Players play a series of 6 games, interchanging the roles of
            CodeMaker and CodeBreaker.<br>
            <br>
            The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code coloured pegs.
            (Duplicates and blanks are not allowed.) The chosen pattern is
            placed in the four holes, visible only to the codemaker. <br>
            The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and
            colour, within ten turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of
            code pegs on the decoding board. <br>
            Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to
            four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A black
            key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct
            in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence
            of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position. <br>
            <br>
            Guesses and feedback continue until either the codebreaker guesses
            correctly, or ten incorrect guesses are made. The codemaker gets one
            point for each guess the codebreaker makes. An extra point is earned
            by the codemaker if the codebreaker is unable to guess the exact
            pattern within 10 turns. The winner is the one who has the most
            points after the 6 games are played.</td>
